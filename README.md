# Brick-Breaker
A 2D Brick-Breaker shooting game made in OpenGL 3.0.

This is a 2D laser shooting game, where the player fires laser beams from a canon on the left to targets that are randomly dropping from top of the screen.
There are some mirrors placed in the way which can deflect lasers according to the laws of reflection. The player can control the angle and vertical position and firing of the canon and gets points for shooting the target (black bricks).
